# SENTIMANT-ANALYSIS

This project is a comprehensive text analysis and sentiment classification tool. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze and classify text data into sentiment categories. The project consists of the following key components:

Text Preprocessing: Text data is preprocessed to remove noise, including special characters, stopwords, and lemmatization, to prepare it for analysis.

Sentiment Analysis with NLTK: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is used to perform sentiment analysis on the text data. It employs the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool to assign sentiment scores and labels to each sentence or tweet.

Sentiment Analysis with Hugging Face Transformers: The project leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library to fine-tune a pre-trained RoBERTa model for sentiment classification. This model assigns sentiment labels and scores to the text data, allowing for more accurate sentiment analysis.

Data Concatenation and Cleaning: The project combines and cleans both training and testing datasets. Unnecessary columns are dropped to create a clean dataset for analysis.

Hashtag Extraction: Hashtags are extracted from the text data for further analysis.

GitHub Repository: The project's codebase is hosted on GitHub for easy access and collaboration. It includes Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and sample datasets.

This project provides valuable insights into sentiment analysis and text classification, making it a useful tool for understanding the sentiment behind textual data in various applications, such as social media sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and more.
